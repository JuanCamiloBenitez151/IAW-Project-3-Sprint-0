# Javascript Basic

## Including JavaScript in an HTML Page

# Blocks-leves

To create a variable that can be modified put `let = number`.

To create a conts that cannot caviar use `consts = 1;`.
# Name variables

For the text type variables we create withh `const a = " text ";`.

for the decimal type number we create with `const a = 123;`.

for the boolean  type decimal number we create with `const a = 1.4;`.

# Types of variables

if we see the variable type Spring we will use `.length ()` to know the length of the variable

If we use a variable and want to display specific characters with `substring (0,1)`

if we use a variable to separate a specific character we use
`.slipt (',')`

# Multiple value variable

So you can make an array of objects, for example:
```
conts a = [
conts person {firstname = 'test', lastName = 'last',},
conts person1 {first name = 'test', last name = 'last',}
]
```
To make a variable with more than one value, create an array for example: `conts a = ['a', 'b'].

From there we can create an object where we will define the variables
```''
conts person {
       name = 'test',
       lastName = 'last',
}
```

# Loops 

for (before loop; condition for loop; execute after loop) {
// what to do during the loop
}
## For
The most common way to create a loop in Javascript
## While

Sets up conditions under which a loop executes

## do while
Similar to the while loop, however, it executes at least once and performs a check at the end to see if the condition is met to execute again
## break

Used to stop and exit the cycle at certain conditions

## continue
Skip parts of the cycle if certain conditions are met of 7 24
